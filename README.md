# bcaqr - BCA QR Merchant CLI

A command-line interface tool to interact with qr.klikbca.com and fetch transaction data.

I'm researching this repo in order to understand the encryption of the qr.klikbca.co.id

and yes I'm using code claude with mcp playwright with extension to control the current browser

next todo:
- [ ] restructure and clean up the directory restructure
- [ ] figure out how to reverse engineering this "x-mcb" encryption 
- [ ] maybe reverse engineering the android application
